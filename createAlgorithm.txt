Creating a completely new algorithm for a well-studied problem like determining the space between objects in an image is challenging, but it's possible if you're willing to approach the problem from a new perspective. Here are some steps to guide you:

Identify a unique approach: What hasn't been done yet? This might involve a novel combination of existing methods, the application of methods from a different field, or a completely new theoretical insight. For example, you might use reinforcement learning where an agent learns the optimal path between objects in an image, which has not traditionally been done.

Theoretical understanding: Ensure that you have a solid theoretical understanding of your unique approach. This could involve learning more about the mathematics behind the algorithm or studying relevant scientific literature.

Design your algorithm: Write down a step-by-step method for your algorithm. Be sure to consider edge cases and performance considerations. An algorithm is more than just code â€“ it's a method for solving a problem that should be understandable and implementable in any language.

Implement your algorithm: Implement your new algorithm in Python, using libraries like OpenCV, numpy, and scikit-learn as needed. Make sure to document your code thoroughly so that others can understand your work.

Test your algorithm: Apply your algorithm to a range of problems to see how it performs. This can help you understand where your algorithm excels and where it falls short.

Validate your algorithm: Compare the performance of your algorithm to other, existing algorithms. This will give you an understanding of how your algorithm fits into the current landscape of computer vision techniques.

Publish your findings: If your algorithm is indeed new and performs well, consider writing a paper about it and submitting it to a relevant academic conference or journal. This can help you gain recognition for your work and also allows others to learn from and build upon your algorithm.

Iterate on your design: Based on your testing and validation, there might be room for improvement or modification in your algorithm. Go back to the design stage and make necessary adjustments.

Remember, truly novel algorithms are rare because they require novel insights or approaches. However, it's quite common to build upon existing work in a way that's novel and meaningful. Even if you don't create something entirely new, you might be able to make a significant contribution to the field of computer vision by improving upon existing algorithms.
